## Bash prompt with git info

![bash-prompt](bash-prompt.png)

A simple and beautiful bash prompt that also prints some git information, without any other bells and whistles.

- Shows if a git fetch has not been run for 15 minutes with `☇` character
- Summarizes git status with single letters
- Shows number of ahead / behind commits with remote branch as f.e. `↑1 ↓1`
- Shows the current branch
- Username included in red if running as root
- Shows virtual environment name if one is activated
- Highlights the prompt with a red `⑉` if the exit status of a command > 0
- Configurable host nickname

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chkhd/bash-prompt ~/.bash-prompt

echo 'MY_HOST_NICKNAME=whateveryoulike' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'source ~/.bash-prompt/bash-prompt.sh' >> ~/.bashrc
```


### Support

I use this regularly on MacOS and Linux with latest Bash and Git, no plans to support anything ancient but if you run into issues with recent versions please open an issue.
